Welcome to the Nectar-101 training exercises. This aims to be a gentle introduction to some of the services that are available as part of the Nectar Research Cloud.

## Accessing The Nectar Research Cloud

The Nectar Research Cloud can be used in many ways, but to get started, you'll first need an account.

This can be done by logging into our dashboard, available at <https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au>.

When you first visit the dashboard, you will be redirected to the Australian Access Federation and prompted to choose your institution. Once you've made your choice, you'll be directed to your institution's login page, where you can enter your username and password.

For new users, you'll be prompted to accept the terms and conditions of the Nectar Research Cloud. For existing users, you'll arrive straight to the dashboard.

From the dashboard, you can begin to explore some of the services offered or create some resources.
