## Accessing The Nectar Research Cloud

The Nectar Research Cloud can be used in many ways, but to get started, you'll need an account.

This can be done by logging into our dashboard, available at <https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au>.

When you first visit the dashboard, you will be redirected to the Australian Access Federation and prompted to choose you institution. Once you've made your choice, you'll be directed to your institution's login page.

For new users, you'll be prompted to accept the terms and conditions of the Nectar Research Cloud. For existing users, you'll arrive straight to the dashboard.
